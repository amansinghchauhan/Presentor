# Presentor
This application allows users to create Slide Shows(Animations) using the provided Images and Text.

What can be done with this Application?
1) Create Presentations/Animations for your personal/professional use.
2) Just Drag & Drop items to add an element to the Presentation.
3) Delete any element.
4) Change the Animation, Time or Size of the Images.
5) Same can be done with TEXT too but alongwith all this, you can change the Font, Color & Styling of the Text.
6) You can change the Text to whatever you want to Write.
7) Add Blank Screens to create a new Slide.
8) Add Pause/Breaks to give people more time to read/watch.
9) Play the Animation by clicking the Play Button.


What more can be done that I didn't do?
I could have added much more functionalities but I wanted to start working on something new and so, I didn't.
Also, I didn't care much about how the site looks because I didn't mean to use it commercially. For me, it was a good learning opportunity, that's it.
So, here are some more things that can be added in the site to make the usability better and use the application commercially, may be.
1) Improve the Layout, obviously.
2) Make the site responsive but only for screens bigger than 11 inches.
3) Allow the users to change the start & end time of the elements, like to drag the 4th element to 1st place and rearragnge the array with the new time for all the elements.
4) Add the Resizable property to the elements so that the users could just resize the elements on the screen instead of inputting a Size in the Text Boxes.
5) Start the Animation from the Time for which element the user pushed the Play Button.
6) Allow the users to save there presentations in a JSON file so that they can import and edit the presentations in future.

Well, these are all the easy changes and should not take more than an hour or two to work on. The challenge here is to allow the users to save the presentation in a video format without asking them to record it with a screen recorder.

If you are able to do all these changes, you got a million dollar application with you.
